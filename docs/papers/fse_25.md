# Refactoring Detection in C++ Programs with RefactoringMiner++

## Evaluation

We evaluated the performance of RefactoringMiner++ by comparing it with RefactoringMiner using a set of programs generated by ChatGPT.
For each program, we created two versions: one representing the code before a specific refactoring and another after the refactoring was applied.
These programs were written in both Java and C++, ensuring identical behavior across the two languages. 

The table below outlines the refactoring types used for evaluation, indicating
 - whether we needed to explain the refactoring type to ChatGPT,
 - whether a single prompt was sufficient to generate code with the refactoring type correctly applied,
 - whether the refactoring type was detected by both RefactoringMiner and RefactoringMiner++,
 - and the corresponding ChatGPT conversation for each case.

All code snippets, before and after refactoring, for both Java and C++, are available in the `testdata/` folder.
